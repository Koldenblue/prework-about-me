      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! I am excited about learning coding and web development!
        I hope to apply these skills to future professional work.
        I have a Ph.D. in chemistry. I've done work running a property management business, and I've been a 
        group fitness instructor for a few years. My two brothers work with programming, and I'm excited to transition to 
        programming work as well!
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Southern California.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy playing music - I mainly play bass guitar and guitar, and I mess around with synths sometimes. I also enjoy playing video games.
        Finally, I enjoy teaching dance and kickboxing, and I try to attend several group fitness classes a week.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I think it would be awesome to be a video game programmer! Or a rock star!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Culver City, California.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've been interested in programming for a long time. I wanted to make a video game when I was a teenager. But I didn't become a Computer Science major in 
        college, and my career path led elsewhere. However, I've been unsure of my career for a long time, and I'm absolutely ready for a change. 
        As I get older, I know more and more that I need to do what's right for me. I look to my younger brothers for inspiration - one is a software engineer
        and majored in Computer Science in college. The other went through a training camp to become a data scientist, after getting his Ph.D. in physics. And finally, his 
        significant other found success with a boot camp and a career change as well. Ultimately, I want to do something I'm passionate about. I want to do something
        something I've thought of as an excellent idea for a long time. I want to make a change in my life for the better.
